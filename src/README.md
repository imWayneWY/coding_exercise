* Using Packages
  
  + axios: Fetching data
  + react-router-dom: Simple router management
  + Markdown-it: Render markdown to html
  I didn't use Redux because this is only a small project and doesn't need redux to manage states for multiple pages

* About Fetching
  
  I only fetch the data once on the load of the communities list page. In real project, the api should has some keywords and page number to get. And the home information will be easy to track with using ID and Page to Get.

* Promise or Async
  
  Obviously, coding use async would be easy to read, just need use try/catch to catch error. Because this demo only need two request to get data so I just simply use promise to handle it.

* Didn't use UI library
  
  The same reason, using Material-UI , Ant-Design or something else is not necessary because this project only have some little style need to handle.

* Others
  
  I also used to want to design a homes list page which can be visited after click the community card. I didn't implement it because the homes' information is a little lack,  and also considering the time limit.
