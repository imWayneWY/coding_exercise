* Using Packages
  + axios: Fetching data
  + react-router-dom: Simple router management
  I didn't use Redux because this is only a small project and doesn't need redux to manage states for multiple pages

* About Fetching
  I only fetch the data once on the load of the communities list page. In real project, the api should has some keywords and page number to get. And the home information will be easy to track with using ID and Page to Get.
